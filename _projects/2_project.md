## Imaging of Fibrous Tissues
We are working on computational modeling of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in fibrous tissue, with a particular focus on skeletal muscle. We have developed numerical models of how dMRI is influenced by a tissues microstructural environment, characterized the sensitivity of this signal to microstructural changes, and developed data-driven inverse models that predict microstructural parameters from dMRI images.
